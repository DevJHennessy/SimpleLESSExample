<h1>A Simple LESS Example Site</h1>

<p>This project shows how to use Leaner Style Sheets (LESS). The LESS files in this project are auto-compiled into CSS, creating a separate CSS file that is then linked to the HTML file. What is demonstrated: how to use variables for fonts and colors, how to lighten/darken colors by percentages, how to use math operations to increase font sizes with a baseFont variable. How to use nested rules for cleaner code and easier reading, and how to use mixins. In this case a mixin creates rounded corners (border radius) and has an optional default value. I also employed separate LESS sheets with import statements in the mainstyle file to show how LESS can be more modular.</p>
